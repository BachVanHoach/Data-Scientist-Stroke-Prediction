## Domain Background

Stroke is a medical condition that occurs when blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced, resulting in the death of brain cells. It is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for improving stroke outcomes. Data science and machine learning techniques can play a significant role in predicting stroke risk and assisting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

## Problem Statement

The problem addressed in this project is to predict the likelihood of an individual experiencing a stroke based on their demographic and health-related attributes. By leveraging a dataset containing information about patients, we aim to build a predictive model that can assist in identifying individuals at risk of stroke and potentially guide preventive measures.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Brain Stroke Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/brain-stroke-dataset/data) available on Kaggle. It contains information about individuals and their attributes related to stroke, such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, and more. The dataset provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models for stroke prediction.

## Solution Statement

The project's solution involves developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of stroke based on the provided dataset. By applying various classification algorithms and techniques, we aim to build a predictive model that achieves high accuracy and can be used as a tool for stroke risk assessment.

## Install

To run the code and reproduce the results of this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from the [Brain Stroke Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/brain-stroke-dataset/data) on Kaggle.

2. Set up a Python environment with the required dependencies. You can install the necessary packages by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook (`stroke_prediction.ipynb`) in a Python environment such as Anaconda or Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing.

## Usage

To use the code and apply the trained model for stroke prediction, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have completed the installation steps mentioned above.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`stroke_prediction.ipynb`) and execute the code cells sequentially.

3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

4. Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the likelihood of stroke for new individuals by providing their relevant attributes as input.

By following these steps, you can utilize the code and trained model to perform stroke prediction based on the provided dataset.

Note: Make sure to cite and acknowledge the original source of the dataset when using it for your own research or applications.
